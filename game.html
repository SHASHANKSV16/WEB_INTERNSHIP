    <h1><b> Nature</b></h1>

    <p><u>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the
            physical world, and also to life in general.</u>
    <div> The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.
        Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural
        phenomena.Ecosystems are composed of a variety of biotic and abiotic components that function in an interrelated
        way.[41] The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated.
        Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important
        components are soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.</div>

            Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that living organisms interact with every other element in
            their local environment. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: "Any unit that includes all of the
            organisms (ie: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of
            energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles</div>
